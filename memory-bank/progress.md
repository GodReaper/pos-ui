## Progress

- **Implemented**:
  - Core admin flows for managing areas and tables, including CRUD operations and grid-based table view per area.
  - Server-side auth utilities and biller layout gating access to `/biller`.
- **In Progress**:
  - Biller table canvas on `/biller` with area selector, table grid, polling, and inline order panel (this task).
- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement `/biller` client page with polling.
  - Extract reusable `TableCard` and `TableGrid` components for both admin and biller experiences if needed.
  - Add status color mapping helper for POS-specific status colors.
